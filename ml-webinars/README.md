# ML webinars
Material for some webinars on machine learning

## Topics

The topics that were requested to be covered (so far) are:

* Supervised models (with sklearn)
	* Build models and evaluate with unseen data
	* Classification, regression, pipelines, evaluation
* Unsupervised models
	* Grouping data, transforming, visualising, extracting information
	* Interpretable groupings
	* Hierarchical + tSNE
* Linear classifiers
	* Linear classifiers (specified logreg, SVM, KNN, SVC)
* Tree based models
	* General tree based models, inlcuding hyperparameter tuning
* XGBoost and general boosting models
	* Same as above but specifically for XGBoost
* Cluster analysis (unsupervised > clustering)
	* Hierarchical + Kmeans and general clustering
* Dimensionality reduction
	* Remove irrelevant features and general dimensionality reduction
	* Include stuff like remove irrelevant characteristics, PCA, maybe could extend to embeddings
* Practical example
