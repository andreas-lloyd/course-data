# Ames real estate
The idea of this was to build a classifier for the generic Kaggle real estate data that is dropped in a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JYZiMt5t3DY8MAqBPj0ha547D6JTXs-tFtv6fUMqSmY/edit?usp=sharing) and can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques) too.

The goal isn't to build an extensive guide to machine learning in Python, but just to do a quick run through of the data and produce an example model.
